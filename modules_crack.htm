<h3>crack </b></font>(Granger et al. 1984; Gray et al., 1986)</h3>

<p>This module is defined in Classcrack and handles frozen soil infiltration during the
spring snow melt. This module is based upon 15 years of study of the snow hydrology of the
Prairie region and results reported in the former USSR. </p>

<h3>Notes</h3>

<p>The Division of Hydrology at the University of Saskatchewan (Granger et al. 1984; Gray
et al., 1985), postulated that the infiltration potential of frozen soils may be grouped
in three broad categories, namely: restricted, limited and unlimited.</p>

<p><em>Restricted</em> - Infiltration is impeded by an impermeable layer, such as an ice
lens on the soil surface or within the soil close to the surface. For all practical
purposes, the amount of meltwater infiltration can be assumed to be negligible and that
the melt goes directly to runoff and to evaporation.</p>

<p><em>Limited</em> - Infiltration is governed primarily by the snow-cover water
equivalent and the frozen water content of the top 30 cm. of soil.</p>

<p><em>Unlimited</em> - A soil with a high percentage of large, air-filled macropores at
the time of melt. Examples of soils having these properties are dry, heavily cracked clays
and coarse, dry sands, organics and others.</p>

<p>Within the model there is not sufficient information to determine these classifications
automatically and as a result the user is required to specify these properties for each
HRU every fall and input this information to the model as a parameter. The one case the
model does handle is when there is an early melt and the subsequent re-freezing causing an
ice lens to form. This will change both Limited to Restricted. Implementation of the
infiltration to frozen soils routines is described below.</p>
<i>

<p>Definitions</p>
</i>

<p>1. Index = INF/SWE where INF=5(1-<font FACE="Symbol">q</font> p)*SWE^0.584.</p>

<p>2. Potential = INF/6.</p>

<p>3. MELT_THRESHOLD = 5 mm. Minimum daily meltwater at which the melt routine is enabled.
Lower meltwater levels are not counted as one of the six major melt events.</p>

<p>4. A major melt is a day when the amount of meltwater generated is greater than the
MELT_THRESHOLD.</p>

<p>5. Six major daily melts are allowed before the limited infiltration category is
changed to Restricted.</p>

<p>The Frozen Soil Infiltration routine</p>

<p>1. The Frozen Infiltration routine is enabled in an HRU when its SWE is greater than
50mm.&nbsp; Each HRU is handled independently.</p>

<p>2. Limited infiltration is triggered into operation by the first major melt. At this
time, Index and Potential are calculated from the soil moisture (<font FACE="Symbol">q</font>
p) and the SWE of the snowpack. </p>

<p>3. The Frozen Infiltration routine is disabled in an HRU when its SWE reaches zero.</p>

<p>The three frozen soil categories are described below.</p>

<p><em>LIMITED</em></p>

<p>1. Only six major over-winter snowmelt events are possible before the infiltration
potential becomes Restricted.</p>

<p>2. Meltwater amounts less than the MELT_THRESHOLD is handled as runoff unless the
parameter <em>PriorInfiltration</em>are is set,&nbsp; then all of the melt is permitted to
infiltrate into the soil. Once the&nbsp; MELT_THRESHOLD has been exceeded it is assumed
that spring snowmelt has begun and only an amount of meltwater equal to MELT*Index will
infiltrate and the remainder will be handled as runoff.</p>

<p>3. Index and Potential are recalculated if another major melt occurs with a greater
SWE.</p>

<p>4. If the temperature the day following a major melt event is colder than -10ºC, the
category is changed from Limited to Restricted assuming an ice lens has formed.</p>

<p>5. When the SWE of the snowpack is zero,&nbsp; the model returns to the module that
handles unfrozen infiltration.</p>

<p><em>UNLIMITED</em></p>

<p>1. All meltwater is allowed to infiltrate.</p>

<p>2. If the temperature the day after a major melt event is less than -10ºC, the
category remains unchanged and all the melt water still infiltrates into the soil.</p>

<p>3. When the SWE of the snowpack is zero,&nbsp; the model returns to the module that
handles unfrozen infiltration.</p>

<p><em>RESTRICTED</em></p>

<p>1. No meltwater is allowed to infiltrate.</p>

<p>2. When the SWE of the snowpack is zero,&nbsp; the model returns to the module that
handles unfrozen infiltration.</p>

<h3>Rain on Snow.</h3>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The energy component of Rain on Snow was not handled when the Rain
on Snow occurs before melt.&nbsp; All the Rain on Snow is accumulated before melt and
released when the first melt occurs, i.e. snowmelt is greater than zero.&nbsp; This is can
be seen by an inspection of RainOnSnow as it remains at zero until there is melt in the
HRU.&nbsp; The Rain on Snow is accumulated before melt in an internal variable RainOnSnowA
which is not accessible to the user.</p>
