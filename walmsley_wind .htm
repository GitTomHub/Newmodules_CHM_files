<p>This module is defined in Classwalmsley_wind and is parametric version of windflow
model of Mason and Sykes (1979), referred as MS. The MS windflow model is a computational
routine for estimating windflow over three-dimensional topography and is based on Fourier
transform techniques and has a division of the inner and outer flow regions. The MS
windflow model is linearized and thus only applies to low hills; the model assumes neutral
thermal stratification and uniform surface roughness within the simulation region. The MS
model is potentially computational costly and Walmsley et al. (1989) derived a simple
parametric version of the MS model for estimating wind speed variation induced by
small-scale topographic features. These topographical features include 2D hills (ridges),
3D hills, 2D escarpments, 2D rolling terrain, 3D rolling terrain, and flat terrain. Users
can define their simulation topographic features from coefficients &#145;A&#146; and
&#145;B&#146;.</p>
