<h3>Netroute</font></b></h3>

<p>This module defined in ClassNetroute, handles the routing of surface runoff, subsurface
runoff and HRU routing using the lag and route method described by <a
href="Modules_new.chm::/Clarks_Method.htm">Clark(1945)</a>. Outflow from a HRU
is calculated by lagging its inflow by the travel time through the HRU, then routing it
through an amount of linear storage defined by the storage constant, K. The outflow from a
HRU can be diverted to the inflow of another HRU or directed to the basin outlet. The
parameter &#145;order&#146; ensures that the outflows from the various HRUs are calculated
in the correct order from upstream to downstream. The parameter &#145;whereto&#146;
defines the destination of an HRU outflow. A non zero value indicates flow to another HRU
and a zero value specifies to the basin outflow.</p>

<p>The sum of runoff and snowmelt runoff may be delayed using independent Clark routing
objects before being handled as input to the main HRU Clark object.</p>

<p>Similarly the subsurface runoff may also be delayed using an independent Clark object
before being handled as input to the main HRU Clark routing object.</p>

<p>The delayed runoff and subsurface runoff are added and applied to the common HRU Clark
routing object.</p>

<p>The output flow of an HRU may be diverted to another HRU by using the <em>whereto</em>
parameter.&nbsp; This flow is used to top up the depression storage (Sd in the Soil
module) and the soil moisture recharge layer (soil_rechr in the Soil module) of the HRU
during the current time step. Any surplus is returned to the soil module by the <em>put</em>
variable&nbsp; redirected_residual and is added to the soil_runoff variable during the
next time step. The parameters soil_rechr_ByPass and Sd_ByPass may be used to prevent
replenishing the recharge and depressional storage.</p>

<p>The groundwater flow from an HRU may be diverted to another HRU by using the
'gwwhereto' parameter. The gw flow is added to the input flow of the particular HRU after
the recharge layer (soil_rechr in the Soil module) and the HRU free depressional storage
(Sd in the Soil module) has been replenished. The parameters soil_rechr_ByPass and
Sd_ByPass may be used to prevent replenishing the recharge and depressional storage.</p>

<h3>Notes.</h3>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The redistribution of water between HRU's is handled by Netroute.
The interval outflow from an HRU may be directed to another HRU or designated as basin
flow using the whereto parameter.&nbsp; When directed to another HRU, any water is first
used to top up&nbsp;the soil recharge layer if soil_rechr_ByPass is not enabled and then
any surplus applied to Depression or Pond storage (Sd) if Sd_ByPass is not enabled and
then the excess is added to the HRU's inflow. If the whereto parameter is 0, the outflow
is accumulated in basin flow. The last HRU is basin flow, so whereto is always 0.</p>
