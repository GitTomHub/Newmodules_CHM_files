<h3><b><font face="Arial">pbsm</font></b>
(Pomeroy and Li, 1999) </h3>
<p>Defined in Classpbsm. This module calculates snow transport
and sublimation. The
snowfall observation can be a daily total or the actual interval
snowfall.&nbsp; The
former case&nbsp; is handled by assuming that the snowfall is
uniformly distributed over
every interval of the day. The transport and sublimation of blowing
snow are calculated
every interval using the interval wind speed, air temperature and
relative humidity. The
model has been extended to handle the transport of snow between HRUs.
At the end of a day
when snow transport has occurred,&nbsp; snow transported from HRUs
with low roughness is
distributed over the HRUs with greater roughness according to the
fractions specified in
the distribution parameter. No transported snow enters the HRU with the
lowest roughness.
When HRUs with lower vegetative height fill to their maximum,&nbsp;
the excess is
distributed over the remaining unfilled HRUs.</p>

<h3>Notes</h3>
<ol>
<li>The parameter <em>fetch</em> cannot be less
than 300m.</li>
<li>The parameter <em>distrib</em> for the first
HRU is used differently from all the other HRUs.&nbsp; It
determines the drift into the model basin based upon the drift out of
the first HRU.&nbsp; BasinSnowGain is equal to
distrib[HRU1]*Drift[HRU1].</li>
<li>The first HRU, i.e. the lowest vegetation height. When the
snow is redistributed,&nbsp; the <em>distrib</em>
values for the HRU's not filled to their vegetation height are summed
and each HRU receives its share.&nbsp; The sum of distributions
need not add to 1.0.</li>
</ol>
<p>E.g. if the transport D is redistributed over HRUs: A, B and C
with their <em>distrib</em>
parameter having values of a, b and c respectively.&nbsp; The snow
transport would be
distributed as:</p>
<p>a*D/(a + b +c),&nbsp; b*D/(a + b +c) and c*D/(a + b
+c).&nbsp; Note that any excess
from a HRU filling to its vegetation height is deposited in the last
HRU, i.e. the one
having the tallest vegetation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.&nbsp; If the value of <em>distrib</em>
is less than 0 for an HRU,
all snow transport to its capacity is assumed to be caught by this HRU.
The next HRU is
the beginning of a new blowing snow regime.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4.&nbsp; Cumulative drift
from the last HRU is handled as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
distrib &gt; 0.0 -&nbsp;the drift is handled as described
above. Any excess after the vegetation is full is transported out of
the basin - i.e. added to 'BasinSnowLoss'.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
distrib &lt; 0.0 - all drift is deposited in the hru.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
distrib == 0.0 - all drift is transported out of the basin -&nbsp;
i.e. added to 'BasinSnowLoss'.</p>
