<p>This module will handle summer and winter interception when
the algorithms are
finalized. At present it is included to handle the change of names
required across the
canopy&nbsp; because of canopy storage and evaporation. It is in
effect a <em>null</em>
module.</p>

<h3><a href="Modules_new.chm::/term_variable.htm">Variables</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>net_rain (mm/int) - the amount of rainfall received by the
ground surface under the canopy in time step, int. It is equal to the
amount of rain received at the top of the canopy less the amount
intercepted by the vegetation. </li>
<li>cumnet_rain (mm) - cummulatve rainfall.</li>
<li>net_snow (mm/int) - the amount of snowfall received by the
ground surface under the canopy in time step, int. It is equal to the
amount of snowfall received at the top of the canopy less the amount
intercepted by the vegetation.</li>
<li>cumnet_snow (mm) - cumulative hru_snow minus interception.</li>
<li>net_p (mm/int) - the total amount of preciptitation (rain +
snow) received by the ground surface under the canopy in time step,
int. It is equal to the amount of precipitation the top of the canopy
less the amount intercepted by the vegetation.</li>
<li>intcp_evap (mm/int) - HRU Evaporation from interception.
Always zero.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a href="Modules_new.chm::/term_parameter.htm">Parameters</a></h3>
