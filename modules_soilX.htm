<h3><b><font face="Arial">SoilX</font></b></h3>
<p>This module is defined in ClassSoilX and handles soil moisture
accounting throughout
the year. It uses module XG to handle freezing soils. When snow cover
is present, the input to this module is the
infiltration
(snowinfil) generated by the modules crack, frozen etc.&nbsp; From
the end of snow melt
till late fall the infiltration (infil) is generated by the modules
Greencrack,
PrairieInfiltration etc. The soil is handled as two layers. The upper
layer is called the
recharge layer and represents the top soil. Evaporation can occur from
the recharge layer,
soil_moist (all layers) or none. The surface infiltration satisfies the
recharge layer
before being used by the lower layer. The excess water from both soil
layers contribute to
the ground water flow, depressional storage and then to sub surface
flow. The
depressional storage is allowed to drain to ground water and sub
surface flow.The
parameters soil_rechr_max and soil_moist_max represents the maximum
soil moisture capacity
for the two layers i.e. field capacity. Wilt occurs when the state
variables soil_rechr
and soil_moist are equal to zero.</p>
<p>Evaporation and subsurface runoff are handled after
infiltration. The maximum amount of
evapotranspiration is calculated by the module&nbsp; <em>evap</em>.
There is a variation
(#1) to handle HRU runoff through a culvert.</p>
<p>In this version of the module the evaporation is taken from
the runoff instead of the
soil column until the recharge layer of the soil has begun to thaw.</p>

<h3><a href="Modules_new.chm::/term_input_variable.htm">Handling
of Layers</a></h3>
When a project is built the number of &nbsp;layers is set in NLAY.<br>
Since the module 'SoilX' uses only two layers NLAY must be 2 or greater..<br>
<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set Sdmax to zero and
soil_moist to non- zero to model HRU with no
Depression or Pond storage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set Sdmax to non-zero and
soil_moist to non- zero to model HRU with
Depression storage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set Sdmax to non-zero and
soil_moist to zero to model HRU with Pond
storage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The significant difference
between Pond and Depression storage is
that soil_runoff to Pond storage is unlimited to its maximum capacity
whereas depression
storage is also limited to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(Sdmax-Sd)*(1-exp(-soil_runoff/Sdmax)).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The layer soil_rechr is part of
the soil_moist zone.&nbsp; It is not
a separate identity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Evaporation from bare soil and
shallow crops only occurs from the
recharge layer. &nbsp; All other cover types&nbsp; have
evaporation/transpiration from
recharge and soil moisture layers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>transp_limited</em>
is provided to limit grasses, shrubs and
trees to only the recharge layer when the vegetation limits
transpiration during drought
conditions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>infil</em>, <em>snowinfil</em>
and condensation are added to the
recharge layer and then to soil_moist. The excess is next used to
satisfy groundwater. The
surplus is designated as soil_runoff. The incoming runoff and
meltrunoff are added to
soil_runoff.&nbsp; If depression storage is specified any
soil_runoff is used to fill the
depression storage to its maximum.</p>
