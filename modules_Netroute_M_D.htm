<h3>Netroute_M_D</font></b></h3>

<p>This module defined in ClassNetroute_M_D, handles the routing of surface runoff,
subsurface runoff and HRU routing using the Muskingum method. Outflow from a HRU is
calculated by lagging its inflow by the travel time through the HRU, then routing it
through an amount of linear storage defined by the storage constant, K. The outflow from a
HRU can be diverted to the inflow of other HRUs and to the basin outlet. The parameter
&#145;distrib_Route&#146; determines&nbsp; the outflow of an HRU to the other HRUs. The
parameter &#145;distrib_Basin&#146; determines&nbsp; the amount of outflow of an HRU to
the the basin outflow.&nbsp; </p>

<p>The sum of runoff and snowmelt runoff may be delayed using independent Clark routing
objects before being handled as input to the main HRU Clark object.</p>

<p>Similarly the subsurface runoff may also be delayed using an independent Clark object
before being handled as input to the main HRU Clark routing object.</p>

<p>The delayed runoff and subsurface runoff are added and applied to the common HRU Clark
routing object.</p>

<p>The output flow of an HRU may be diverted to another HRU by using the
&#145;distrib_Route&#146; parameter.&nbsp; This flow is used to top up the depression
storage (Sd in the Soil module) and the soil moisture recharge layer (soil_rechr in the
Soil module) of the HRUs during the current time step. Any surplus is returned to the soil
module by the <em>put</em> variable&nbsp; redirected_residual and is added to the
soil_runoff variable during the next time step. The parameters soil_rechr_ByPass and
Sd_ByPass may be used to prevent replenishing the recharge and depressional storage.</p>

<p>The groundwater flow from an HRU may be diverted to another HRU by using the
'gwwhereto' parameter. The gw flow is added to the input flow of the particular HRU after
the recharge layer (soil_rechr in the Soil module) and the HRU free depressional storage
(Sd in the Soil module) has been replenished. The parameters soil_rechr_ByPass and
Sd_ByPass may be used to prevent replenishing the recharge and depressional storage.</p>

<h3>Notes.</h3>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The distrib_Route parameter if positive is used as is. &nbsp;
However,&nbsp; if negative it is multiplied by the HRU area and made positive before being
used.&nbsp; The last drainage HRU can only flow to the basin outlet. For the last drainage
HRU the distrib_Route values must be zero..</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The parameter distrib_Basin must always be zero or greater.&nbsp; If
the last drainage HRU has distrib_Basin set to zero it is forced to one.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The redistribution of water between HRU's is handled by Netroute_D.
&nbsp; The interval outflow from an HRU may be directed to another HRU or designated as
basin flow using the distrib_Basin and&nbsp; distrib_Route parameters.&nbsp; When directed
to another HRU, any flow is first used to top up&nbsp;the soil&nbsp; recharge layer
(soil_rechr), if soil_rechr_ByPass is not set, then to top the Depression or Pond storage
(Sd) if Sd_ByPass is not set and finally any excess is directed to the designated HRU's
inflows. The absolute value of the parameter values determines the contribution to each
destination.&nbsp; E.g, if the outflow of HRU 1 is Outflow1, then the diversion to HRU 2
would be N2*Outflow1/(B1 +&nbsp; N1 + N2 + N3 + N4 ...Nn),&nbsp; where B1 is the amount of
HRU 1's output to basin flow and N1 to Nn the contribution of HRU1 to the other HRUs.
Normally. Sinnce an HRU cannot recirculate its output to itself, in this example N1 would
be zero.</p>
