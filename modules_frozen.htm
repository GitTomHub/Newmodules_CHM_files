<p>This module defined in Classfrozen calculates the 'Limited'
infiltration into soils
where the infiltrability is governed by the soil moisture content
(water + ice) and soil
temperature at the start of snow ablation and the infiltration
opportunity time.</p>

t0 when parameter t0 is equal to zero.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a href="modules_new.chm::/term_parameter.htm">Parameters</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>t0 (h) - Infiltration opportunity time. If &lt; 0 -
calculate opportunity time by running forward (not reccommended), == 0
- calculate t0 from '0.65*SWE-5.0',&nbsp; &gt; 0 - use as
opportunity time. The
values are saved in t0_var for reference.</li>
<li>t0_Julian&nbsp;() -value &gt; 0 - inhibit frozen
algorithm till
after this Julian date, 0 - enable frozen algorithm immediately when
melt criteria is met.</li>
<li>S0 (m^3/m^3) - surface saturation.</li>
<li>Si (m^3/m^3) - initial soil saturation.</li>
<li>C () - coefficient.</li>
<li>hru_tsoil (ºK) - soil average temperature at start of
frozen infiltration.</li>
<li>t_ice_lens(ºC) - overnight minimum to cause ice lens after
major melt.</li>
<li>soil_moisture_max (mm) - soil moisture maximum. Common to
module <em>smbal</em>.</li>
<li>basin_area (km^2) - area of watershed.</li>
<li>hru_area(km^2) - area of HRUs.</li>

<h3>Notes.</h3>
<ol>
<li>Calibration.&nbsp; Since the opportunity time is not
known until the model is run through the complete frozen infiltration
period,&nbsp; the model has to be run twice. &nbsp; The user,
by setting t0[HRU 1] to &lt;= 0.0 causes the module to calculate
the infiltration opportunity time. During this run the module
forces all HRUs to ignore snowmelt, i.e. snow infiltration and runoff
are zero.&nbsp; At the end of the model run
the newly calculated opportunity times are transferred to the
parameter and saved in t0_Var for future reference.&nbsp;
If the run is terminated early the partially
calculated values will be used.&nbsp; The calculated infiltration
opportunity times saved in t0_Var may be manually transferred to t0 to
eliminate the need for calculation in subsequent runs.</li>
<li>Maximum infiltration is limited to the lesser of Inf
calculated from the equation above and the available storage in the
module smbal, i.e. (soil_moist - soil_moist_max).</li>
<li>Accumulation of the opportunity time when calculating.
Normally 24 hours is added for every day when melt occurs. However,
this may be refined by using the observation input
t0_inhibit.&nbsp; When this input is not connected or its value is
zero,&nbsp; the interval is added to the infiltration opportunity
time. When t0_inhibit is greater than 0.0 the interval is not added.</li>
<li>When
the average SWE is &gt; 2.0 mm the&nbsp;module exits the
unfrozen
infiltration mode and enters the frozen infiltration cycle. While the
daily snow melt (snowmeltD) is less than &nbsp;2.0 mm</li>
<li>Rainfall precipitation is always allowed to
infiltrate("infil". "runoff" is always zero.</li>
<li>Snowmelt occurring before snowmeltD exceeds 2.0 mm is
handled as premelt. During this period, if the parameter "Si" is 1.0
the early snowmelt is handled as "meltrunoff" otherwise it is
"snowinfil".</li>
<li>After the snowmelt is greater than 2 mm the snowmelt is
handled as follows; Si &gt;= 1.0 -&gt; RESTRICTED,
&nbsp;1.0 &gt; Si &gt; 0.0 -&gt; LIMITED and Si
&lt;= 0.0 -&gt; LIMITED.</li>
<li>The rate of infiltration and the maximum amount of
infiltration during LIMITED infiltration is controlled by the method
described in&nbsp;'Frozen soil infiltration Zhao and Gray (1999)'.</li>
<li>The Opportunity Time is calculated as the period beginning
from when the snowmelt exceeds 2 mm per day until the average of all
HRU SWE is less then 2 mm.</li>
