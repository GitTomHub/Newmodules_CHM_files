<p ALIGN="CENTER">FROZEN SOIL INFILTRATION MODULE</p>

<p>Infiltration Algorithm</p>
</b>

<p>CRHM contains a module for estimating snowmelt infiltration into frozen soils. This
algorithm, which is described in detail by Gray et al. (2001} divides frozen soils into
three general <i>&quot;Groups&quot;</i> in terms of their infiltrability for snowmelt
based on their surface entry condition for meltwater. 

<dir>
  <i><b><p>Unlimited</b></i> (predominately gravity flow): soils are capable of infiltrating
  most or all available meltwater. This Group includes:</p>
</dir>

<ul>
  <li>Dry, severely cracked colloidal soils &#150; usually fine-textured mineral soils under
    vegetation during the summer months. </li>
  <li>Dry, coarse-textured and gravelly soils &#150; deep, relatively-uniform profiles and
    sand, sandy loam or other permeable material underlying well-drained peat and organic
    deposits (e.g., forest soils). </li>
  <li>Sloping, shallow, highly permeable deposits underlain by a relatively impermeable
    subsurface material (e.g., forest litter and moss on bedrock, tundra peat on permafrost). </li>
</ul>

<dir>
  <i><b><p>Restricted</b></i>: soils whose infiltrability is restricted by an impervious
  surface. This Group includes:</p>
</dir>

<ul>
  <li>Mineral and other soils frozen in a wet condition (e.g., &gt;70 &#150;80% pore
    saturation).</li>
  <li>Soils in which an impeding layer develops at/near the ground surface. For example, a
    basal ice lens that forms at the soil surface due to rain that occurs near freeze-up or
    the freezing of percolating or infiltrating meltwater.</li>
</ul>

<dir>
  <i><b><p>Limited</b></i> (predominately capillary flow): soil infiltrability is governed
  primarily by the soil moisture content (water + ice) and soil temperature at the start of
  snow ablation and the infiltration opportunity time.</p>
</dir>

<p>Zhao and Gray (1999) describe an expression for cumulative infiltration into frozen,
unsaturated soils of <i><b>Limited</b></i> infiltrability, INF (mm) as:

<dir>
  <dir>
    <font SIZE="2"><p><img SRC="Image1.gif" WIDTH="294" HEIGHT="42"></font> (1) </p>
  </dir>
</dir>

<p>where: C = coefficient,</p>

<p>S<sub>o </sub>= surface saturation - moisture content at the soil surface (mm<sup>3</sup>/mm<sup>3</sup>),

<dir>
  <dir>
    <dir>
      <p>S<sub>I </sub>= average soil saturation (water + ice) of 0-40 cm soil layer at the
      start of infiltration (mm<sup>3</sup>/mm<sup>3</sup>). S<sub>I</sub> = <font FACE="Symbol">q</font>
      <sub>I</sub>/<font FACE="Symbol">f</font> , where <font FACE="Symbol">q</font> <sub>I</sub>
      = average volumetric soil moisture (water + ice) at start of infiltration (mm<sup>3</sup>/mm<sup>3</sup>)
      and <font FACE="Symbol">f</font> = soil porosity (mm<sup>3</sup>/mm<sup>3</sup>),</p>
    </dir>
    <p>T<sub>I</sub> = average temperature of 0-40 cm soil layer at the start of infiltration
    (K), and</p>
  </dir>
</dir>

<p>t<sub>0</sub> = infiltration opportunity time (h).</p>

<p>A brief discussion of the various terms in Eq. 1 and their evaluation in CRHM follows:</p>

<p>Coefficient, C</p>
<font SIZE="3">

<p>C characterizes the effects of variations in the vertical distribution of soil moisture
distribution and other factors on infiltration. For example, Eq. 1 assumes a uniform
distribution in moisture (water + ice) throughout a soil profile; a condition seldom
encountered in nature due to transpiration, evaporation soil morphology and soil water
recharge. The effects of the divergences in soil moisture content with depth on frozen
soil infiltration are taken into account by modifying C according to the expression: </p>

      </dir>
    </dir>
  </dir>
</dir>

<p>in which V<sub>a</sub>, termed the available storage ( cm<sup>3</sup> /cm2), is the
average difference in volumetric soil moisture (water + ice) between natural (field) and
uniform soil moisture profiles over the wetted depth. That is V<sub>a</sub> = average
difference in volumetric soil moisture between natural and uniform profiles over the
wetted depth at the start of infiltration multiplied by the depth of wetting. Negative
values of V<sub>a</sub> represent a profile in which the moisture content increases with
depth and positive values of V<sub>a</sub> represent a profile in which soil moisture
content decreases with increasing depth. Drier soil near the surface enhances infiltration
and values of C &gt; 1; wetter soil near the surface suppress infiltration and C &lt; 1.</p>

<p>Surface Saturation<i>, S<sub>o</sub>: </p>
</i>

<p>Surface saturation during snow ablation is the surface boundary condition that is
affected by the rate that meltwater is released by a snowcover, the infiltration rate of
the frozen ground and the movement of meltwater laterally on the soil surface. Because
reliable techniques for measuring S<sub>o</sub> have not been developed it is suggested
(based on field experience and limited measurements) that S<sub>o</sub> = 0. 75~ 1.00. In
most situations the infiltration rate of a frozen soil is low and a value of S<sub>o</sub>
= 1 should be assumed, especially under conditions when a snowcover ablates rapidly. An
average value for S<sub>o</sub> &lt; 1 may be experienced under slow ablation, when there
are large fluctuations in the melt rate and where the ground surface is highly permeable.
Fine-tuning of the parameter to simulate the effects of cycling in the melt rate might be
achieved by varying the parameter according to the melt rate. Where this is attempted, the
volume of infiltration calculated by the equation should be the same as the amount
determined by an average value of S<sub>o</sub> over the period in the parametric equation
(Eq. l). </p>

<p>Initial soil moisture, S<sub>I</sub>, and initial soil temperature, T<sub>I</sub> </p>

<p>These are input variables to the algorithm </p>

<p>Total (cumulative} infiltration opportunity time t<sub>o</sub>. </p>

<p>Total (cumulative) infiltration opportunity time is calculated by CRHM as the total
(cumulative) elapsed time that meltwater is available at the soil surface for infiltration
following the start of melt</p>
</font><b>

<p>Constraints</p>
</b>

<p>1. Storage: The maximum amount of snow water a frozen soil of <i>Unlimited</i> class
can infiltrate is constrained by its available soil water storage, which on flat land is
equal to the air-filled porosity above an impeding or relatively impermeable layer. The
water storage potential, W<sub>sP </sub>(mm) is calculated from the porosity, <font
FACE="Symbol">f</font> (mm<sup>3</sup>/mm<sup>3</sup>), the average initial saturation
(prior to infiltration), S<sub>I</sub> (mm<sup>3</sup>/mm<sup>3</sup>), and the depth (as
measured from the ground surface), z<sub>p </sub>(mm), of the highly permeable surface
layer (e.g. thickness of organic layer and depth of surface-connected cracks) as:

<dir>
  <dir>
    <p>W<sub>sP</sub> = <font FACE="Symbol">f</font> (1 &#150; S<sub>I</sub>)z<sub>p </sub>(3)
    </p>
  </dir>
</dir>

<p>The product, <font FACE="Symbol">f</font> (1 &#150; S<sub>I</sub>), in Eq. 3 is the
air-filled porosity. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A frozen soil of <i>Limited</i> class in which capillary flow
predominates does not normally become saturated throughout its wetted depth by
infiltrating meltwater because ice blocks the inter-connectivity of soil pores and the
wetting front advances ahead of an a overlying layer of higher moisture. Gray et al.
(1986a) found in frozen mineral agricultural soils of the Canadian Prairies that the upper
limit of saturation, L (mm<sup>3</sup>/mm<sup>3</sup>) of the soil layer wetted by
infiltrating meltwater during snow ablation is related to the average initial saturation
of the layer as: </p>

<dir>
  <dir>
    <i><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">L</i> = 0.6 + 0.4 S<sub>I<i> </i></sub>(4)</p>
  </dir>
</dir>

<p>Combining Eqs. 3 and 4 gives:

<dir>
  <dir>
    <p>W<sub>sP</sub> = 0.6 <font FACE="Symbol">f</font> (1 &#150; S<sub>I</sub>)z<sub>w </sub>(5)</p>
  </dir>
</dir>

<p>in which z<sub>w</sub> is the depth of wetting. Equation 4 suggests that the average
storage potential of a frozen fine-textured mineral soil is of the order of 60% of its
air-filled pore space at the start of infiltration. Replacing z<sub>w</sub> in Eq. 5 by
the depth of frost, z<sub>f, </sub>provides a measure of the potential available storage
of snowmelt water of a <i>Limited </i>soil in the frozen state.</p>

<p>2. Change to unfrozen condition: CRHM tests INF by Eq. 1 against the limiting value for
W<sub>sP</sub> Eqs. 2 and 4 at the end of each time step. For soils with <i>Limited </i>infiltrability
this comparison is used to determine whether a soil had thawed during infiltration.
Thawing enhances infiltration because of the changes to the thermo- and hydrophysical
properties of a soil and to the state and gradients that govern coupled heat and mass
transfers that accompany a phase change. </p>

<p>Komarov and Makarova (1973) suggest that a soil frozen to a depth less than 150 mm
behaves the same as an unfrozen soil in respect infiltration and once it is frozen to 600
mm, freezing to greater depth has no further effect on the process. The assignment of a
specific frozen depth to decide whether a soil remains frozen throughout ablation is
arbitrary and excludes (directly) many of the factors that affect the transfers of heat
and mass during infiltration. CRHM proposes that once infiltrating meltwater has satisfied
the water storage potential of the frozen depth, a soil behaves as an unfrozen soil in
respect to infiltration. </p>
<font SIZE="3">

<p>3. Seasonal infiltration. In cases when z<sub>w</sub> &lt;&lt; z<sub>f</sub>, and W<sub>sP</sub>,
the maximum amount of infiltration of resulting from complete ablation of a seasonal
snowcover (seasonal infiltration, SINF), calculated by Eq. 1 is constrained by the amount
calculated as: 

<dir>
  <dir>
    <p>SINF = 5(1 -S<sub>I</sub>)SWE<sup>0.584</sup> (6) </p>
  </dir>
</dir>

<p>in which SWE is the water equivalent at the start of ablation in mm. </p>
<b>

<p>Depth of Freezing </p>
</b>

<p>The infiltration algorithm requires a soil freezing routine in order to establish the
areal extent of frozen soils and to provide an estimate of the depth of freezing for
calculating the water storage potential of a frozen soil by Eq. 4. CRHM calculates the
depth of freezing or frost depth by the semi-theoretical expression (1963): </font>

<dir>
  <dir>
    <p><img SRC="Image3.gif" WIDTH="232" HEIGHT="94"> (7) </p>
  </dir>
</dir>

<p>in which: z<sub>f</sub> = depth of frost penetration (ft),

<dir>
  <dir>
    <p>k<sub>a</sub> = apparent or effective thermal conductivity (Btu/ft&middot;F&middot;hr),
    </p>
    <p>F = freezing index (?degree-day of frost), i.e., </p>
    <p>[mean daily air temperature ( <sup>o</sup>F) -32], </p>
    <p>L<sub>A</sub> = average latent heat Btu/ft<sup>3</sup>), </p>
    <p>T<sub>A </sub>= mean annual air temp (<sup>o</sup>F), and </p>
    <p>C<sub>pA</sub> = average volumetric heat capacity (Btu/ft<sup>3</sup> &middot;F). </p>
  </dir>
</dir>
<i><b>

<p>Single soil or snow layer </p>
</b></i>

<p>The apparent or effective thermal conductivity, k<sub>l</sub>, the heat capacity, C<sub>pl</sub>,
and the latent heat, L<sub>l</sub>, for a single layer of material is determined by
weighting the respective values for the various constituents comprising the layer by the
volumetric fraction of each of each constituents as: 

<dir>
  <dir>
    <p>k<sub>l</sub> = k<sub>o</sub>F<sub>o</sub> + k<sub>m</sub>F<sub>m</sub> + k<sub>a</sub>F<sub>a</sub>
    + k<sub>j</sub>F<sub>j</sub> + k<sub>w</sub>F<sub>w</sub>, (8)</p>
    <p>C<sub>pl</sub> = C<sub>po</sub>F<sub>o</sub> + C<sub>mm</sub>F<sub>m</sub> + C<sub>pa</sub>F<sub>a</sub>
    + C<sub>pj</sub>F<sub>j</sub> + C<sub>pw</sub>F<sub>w</sub>, and (9) </p>
    <p>L<sub>l</sub> = L<sub>w</sub>F<sub>w</sub>, (10)</p>
  </dir>
</dir>

<p>in which F is the volumetric faction and the subscripts represent the constituents: o -
organic matter, m- mineral (e.g., sand, silt, clay), a- air, i - ice, and w- water,
respectively. The values for k, C<sub>p</sub> and L for the various constituents used in
CRHM are listed in Table 1.</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Flow Chart</p>

<p>A flow chart showing the implementation an algorithm to determine cumulative areal
infiltration on a hydrological response unit is shown in Fig. 1... The definitions of
symbols used in the figure are listed in Table 2. </p>

<p>The first discretization partitions the response unit into landscape units according to
the distribution of snow water. The infiltration model is then applied to each individual
landscape unit that is frozen and receives water from melting snow.

<ul>
  <li>The areas of the landscape having <i>Unlimited, Limited or Restricted </i>infiltrability
    are identified.</li>
  <li>If the land unit is <i>Restricted,</i> infiltration is set to zero.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>If the land unit is <i>Unlimited,</i> infiltration is set to the cumulative meltwater
    release. On flat land the cumulative amount is constrained by the water holding capacity
    of the frozen soil, W<sub>sP</sub>.</li>
  <li>All other portions of the landscape unit have <i>Limited </i>infiltrability and
    infiltration is controlled by the average surface saturation, S<sub>o</sub>, the average
    initial soil saturation, S<sub>I.</sub> and the average initial temperature, T<sub>I</sub>,
    of the 0-40 cm soil layer (Eq. 1) and constrained by the available water storage, W<sub>sP</sub>.
  </li>
  <li>If the study is a mesoscale application, infiltration is estimated using average values
    of S<sub>o</sub>, S<sub>I</sub> and T<sub>I </sub>for the landscape.</li>
  <li>If the study is a microscale application, infiltration is determined at a spatial scale
    set by the either the spatial distribution of S<sub>I</sub> or the scale of the spatial
    distribution of snow water, whichever is smallest. At the smaller scale, infiltration is
    estimated using by Eq. 1 using average values of S<sub>I</sub>, S<sub>o</sub>, and T<sub>I
    </sub>of the smaller unit.</li>
  <li>If cumulative infiltration up to the time exceeds the available water holding capacity
    the soil is considered thawed and the infiltration estimation set to the unfrozen routine.</li>
