<h3></b>Observation Variable.<b></h3>
</b>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Observation climate/meteorological data for the watershed being
modeled drives the model.&nbsp; The data is normally read from a data file with the file
extension obs, (*.obs).&nbsp; However,&nbsp; there are many circumstances when the raw
observation data must be enhanced before use in the model.&nbsp; Examples are when a
limited number of observations must be interpolated over a basin and adjusted for
elevation.&nbsp; Another example is when radiation data is not measured and is instead
synthesized instead other available data.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To handle these circumstances modules can generate Observation
variables which have the properties of observations and have properties similar to normal
variables.&nbsp; The most important property being that the heirarchy of the modules
depends upon observation variables.&nbsp; File observation have no effect on the module
order.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An important point to remember is that when a file observation is
available it will override a module generated observation of the same name.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since Observations are normally satisfied by file Observations no
check can be made to verify that Observation variables satisfy missing module input
observation requirements.</p>
