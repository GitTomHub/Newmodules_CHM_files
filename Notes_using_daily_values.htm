<h3>Using Daily Values as Inputs. !!!jumble of ideas</h3>

<p>Daily values can be generated in several different ways.&nbsp; Depending upon the input
data used the daily value can be available from the beginning of the day or if an
accumulated interval value may not be finalised to the very last interval of the day.
&nbsp; 

<ol>
  <li>The usual daily output derived from HRU interval values&nbsp; is not complete until the
    last interval of the day.&nbsp; This type of output is used during the next day.</li>
  <li>The more rare case is a module using raw observations.&nbsp; In this case observations
    are available for the entire day.&nbsp; The daily value is calculated in the first
    interval and is available throughout the current day.</li>
</ol>

<p>Daily values are accumulated during the day.&nbsp; There value cannot only be used
during the last interval of the day.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The AKA screen allows daily variables to be linked to interval
inputs.&nbsp; This never works.&nbsp; When the value is used as an interval input it is
only correct for the first interval of the day. Every interval after the first, the value
for the first interval will be repeatedly added.&nbsp; There is no solution.&nbsp; One
obvious solution is to divide by Freq (number of intervals in the day). This is not
correct either and under estimates.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A daily value can be used constructively by buffering it - in effect
delaying its use to the next day.&nbsp; At the end of the day the variable is transferred
to another variable and then every interval of the next day using an amount equal to
Accum_daily/Freq every interval.&nbsp; This is a very effective way of smoothing out
spikes caused by transient inputs like rainfall.&nbsp; However, it introduces a lag.</p>
