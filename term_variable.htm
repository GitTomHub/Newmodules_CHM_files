<h3></b>Variable.<b></h3>
</b>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A variable is the time step output of any of the modules making up a
model.&nbsp; It has the dimension of the number of HRUs defined in the model.&nbsp;
Optionally it can have an additional dimension of the number of layers.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The modeling time step is the same as the that of the observation
dataset driving the model,&nbsp; the first observation file interval.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the dimension 'mm' depth is used it should be recognized that
it is actually a volume per unit area, i.e. m<sup>3</sup>/m<sup>2</sup>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The value of the variable is the average value over the HRU.&nbsp;
It may vary dramatically over the HRU, e.g. for snow transport it is zero at the beginning
of the fetch and develops asymptotically to its maximum value.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The value of the variable may be an accumulated value, e.g. the
amount of rainfall from the beginning of the model run.&nbsp; Alternatively,&nbsp; it
could be the change of a quality over a time step, <font SIZE="2"><font FACE="Symbol">D</font>t</font>.&nbsp;
It is not a rate of change as it does not necessarily change at a uniform rate over the
time interval.</p>

<h3>State Variable.</h3>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A state variable is handled identically to a normal variable. &nbsp;
However,&nbsp; when the model state is saved it is written to the state file. &nbsp; This
is necessary as the value of a state variable in the next time interval is a function of
the value at the end of the last time interval.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Examples of state variables are SWE and soil moisture.
&nbsp; Variables like albedo can be state variables if their new value is calculated from
their previous value.&nbsp; Albedo could also be a normal variable if it is calculated
solely from values of variables in the current interval.&nbsp; Diagnostic variables are
sometimes made state variables in order that their value continue after the model run is
broken and restarted by saving the model state.&nbsp; An example is snow accumulation over
a season.&nbsp; If the snow accumulation is not handled as a state variable its value
would restart with a value of zero when the model was restarted from the previous model
state.</p>
