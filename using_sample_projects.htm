<h3>Using Demonstration Models.</h3>
<p>Complete sample projects are distributed with CRHM. These may
be found in the directory "CRHM_project_examples" located in the same
directory as the CHRM&nbsp;executable.</p>
<p>The subdirectories "Bad Lake", "Marmot Creek", "Smith Creek"
and "Yukon" contain complete example projects for different Canadian
regions. These projects may be executed from CRHM using the File/Open
menu or double clicking the project file from Windows Explorer..&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Within CRHM examples of models using different combinations of
modules can be constructed using the pull down menus in the
Build menu screen. To use them use the following steps.
</p>
<ol>
<li>Run CRHM. </li>
<li>Goto the Build/Construct screen to select the desired
number of HRUs and exit this screen using Build to register the
selected number of HRUs..</li>
<li>In the Build screen select the example model desired from
the list.</li>
<li>In the Observation screen select a suitable observation
file. The file "C:\Program Files\CRHM\Examples\Winter1974.obs" can be
used for demonstration purposes only.</li>
<li>Select some variables to display and click on Run to
execute..</li>
</ol>
<p>This is a training exercise. The usual warnings apply, i.e.
the selection of modules,
parameters and set of observations must be relevant to the physical
application to achieve
meaningful results.</p>
<h3>Notes.</h3>
<ul>
<li>It is best to select the number of HRUs before selecting a
sample model,&nbsp; then the default parameters are optimum. When
the number of HRUs is increased after selecting the model,&nbsp;
the last HRU parameter value in the earlier project is duplicated for
the new HRUs.</li>
<li>If a project is already loaded when a sample project is
selected, the current modules loaded will be replaced by the model
selected. The observation files and number of HRUs will not be affected.</li>
<li>When a sample model is selected,. its description is added
to the first line of the prospective project file and also inserted
into the TChart title.</li>
<li>The user must customise all parameters in the model to
define their application.</li>
</ul>
